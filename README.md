# Computational Methods in Linguistics (LING360)

This repository contains my answers for the assignments given throughout the course LING360 on Computational Methods in Linguistics. The assignments cover various topics and projects, including Python basics, regular expressions, control flow, functions, **writing an auto-correction algorithm (assignment 4), pop song generation with n-grams (assignment 5), and mood-based song recommendation by utilizing Naive-Bayes and creating a website for the model with Streamlit (assignment 6)**.

Feel free to explore and get inspired!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
